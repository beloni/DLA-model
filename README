This is a simple project I've created ages ago when I was doing some research at the university. As simple as it is, it works fine. It simulates a celular automata which implements one single rule in the Diffusion-Litmited Aggregation set. Its pattern may represent the ice crystal growth, though the colours used are red and green for better contrast.

The higher the concentration, the faster will be the aggregation. I'd say the ideal concentration percentage is 25% (default).

Red coloured cells are always in movement (diffusion state); when they contact the green coloured ones, they aggregate and stop moving. Black spaces are empty.

To compile, you'll need libgtkmm-2.4.
